# GraphEasy - JavaFX App
GraphEasy is an easy to use, educational tool for visualising equations on a graph. It is written using Java and JavaFX.

Feel free to grab the JAR and give it a go.

The user can enter a formula in the text box, and press the button to add it to the canvas and a list in the UI. There are controls below the textbox for adding special characters, saving and loading data, toggling various UI elements, and so on.

The user can click and drag on the canvas to pan around. The program will automatically recalculate and redraw the axes, the background, and all curves.

Right clicking on two locations adds a line that intersects those two points.

By pressing "Save Screenshot", the user can save the canvas as a PNG to their computer. The save and load buttons save and load the current data, respectively.

Hovering over any element on the left will display a tooltip to explain what things do and what can be done.
